# Articles-Wordpress-Plugin


This is a Wordpress Plugin that allow us to create new Viewers articles 
in the Wordpress panel page and display them in the /viewer page.

Each article allows, as if it were a blog post, to insert a title, 
a text and an image. It will also allow us to assign the categories 
we want.

How to use the Plugin
--------------

When you activate the plugin you can see that the left Wordpress panel 
shows two new items. These are 'Viewer' and 'Viewer_Admin'. 

In the first one you can see a list of articles we create. To create 
new articles we only have to click in the 'Add new viewer' button we 
have above. Then, as if it were a blog post, we can insert a title, 
text, image and its differents categories.

In the second one, the admin page, we can see a list of viewer categories, 
if we have created before. This list of categories allow us to see in the 
/viewer page only the articles of the category we choose.

The only thing we have to do is to select one category and click the 
button bellow to save our choice.
